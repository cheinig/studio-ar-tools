# Studio AR Tools

## Introduction

This plugin should help all BMC AR Developers which use the BMC AR Developer Studio. It starts with the timetable view for archiving and escalation times. Other features were added to this plugin in the past and some will follow in the future.

StART (St udio A ction R equest T ools) helps me developing with the BMC Action Request System, so hopefully it will help others too.

At the moment the following features are available: SQL Editor, Timetable View, "Reporter"
