#summary Installation Guide

==Requirements==

 * BMC Developer Studio 7.6.x 

==Installing StART==

To install the current version of StART, you must copy the content of the "plugins" directory of the StART installation pakage to the "plugins" directory of your installed BMC Developer Studio (e.g. c:\Program Files\BMC Software\ARSystem\DeveloperStudio\plugins).
If you already installed a previous version of StART, you must remove the plugin files from the "plugins" directory of your BMC Developer Studio (delete de.chdev.artools.`*`.jar). After (re-)starting your Developer Studio, the StART plugins should be available.

To check if StART is installed correct, you should check if the StART toolbar is available. StART provides an own toolbar as starting point for the new features.
